My web optimization project


To optimize the site I started with index.html, and I minified all the pictures and CSS.
I synced all of the javascript tags, which is an obvious catch.

I used a script provided by google fonts, to help optimize the site.   

I also reduced the number of pizzas on the screen, I felt such a busy part of the site could be modified in some way. 

By playing with the site I was able to achieve the desired speed of the page.
